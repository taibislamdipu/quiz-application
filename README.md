Title: Interactive Quiz Application

Objective: To build an interactive quiz application using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS that caters to students with different levels of understanding of JavaScript.

Overview: In this assignment, you will develop a simple, yet engaging quiz application that will test the user's knowledge on a topic of your choice. You will create an application that displays questions and multiple-choice answers, tracks the user's score, and provides feedback based on their performance.

Requirements:

1. Design an intuitive and visually appealing user interface using HTML and CSS.
   Use JavaScript to create an array of objects, where each object represents a quiz question with its multiple-choice options and correct answer.

2. Display a random question from the array and its multiple-choice options to the user.
   Allow the user to select an answer and provide immediate feedback on whether their choice was correct or incorrect.

3. Keep track of the user's score and display it throughout the quiz.

4. Implement a 'Next' button that will load the next question and its options.
   Include a progress bar that displays the number of questions answered out of the total number of questions.
   When all questions have been answered, display a summary page with the user's final score and an option to retake the quiz.

5. Scaffolding for students struggling with the material:
   Start by creating a basic HTML structure with placeholders for the quiz elements, such as the question, options, score, and progress bar.

6. Use CSS to style the page with colors, fonts, and layouts that are easy to read and visually appealing.
   In JavaScript, create a simple array of quiz questions with multiple-choice options and correct answers. You can start with just 3-5 questions to keep it manageable.

7. Write a function to display a random question from the array and update the HTML with the question and its options.

8. Add event listeners to the answer buttons to check if the selected answer is correct or incorrect. Update the score and provide feedback accordingly.

9. Implement the 'Next' button functionality and the progress bar using loops and conditionals.
   Create the summary page with the final score and a button to restart the quiz.

Challenges for students with a strong understanding of JavaScript:

1. Implement a timer that gives the user a limited amount of time to answer each question. If the time runs out, mark the question as incorrect and move on to the next question.

2. Store the user's quiz scores in the browser's local storage, so they can see their previous scores and track their progress over time.

3. Add an option for users to add their own custom questions to the quiz.

4. Implement different difficulty levels for the quiz, where each level has a separate set of questions with increasing complexity.

5. Use an API or external data source to fetch a dynamic set of questions for the quiz, instead of hardcoding them in your JavaScript file.
